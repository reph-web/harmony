# Harmony
Harmony is a web-based instant messaging service developed with Symfony.

Users need to register to access the service. The chat operates in real-time using JavaScript polling.

An admin can create multiple chat rooms, restrict access to chats by role, edit usernames, roles, bios, avatars, delete anyone's messages, and delete accounts.

A set of 4 avatars is randomly assigned by default, but users can upload their own profile pictures.
